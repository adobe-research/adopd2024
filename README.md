# ADOPD: A Large-Scale Document Page Decomposition Dataset

![image](preview.png)

**ADOPD** is a large-scale dataset for document page decomposition. It introduces a novel data-driven taxonomy discovery approach, combining large-scale pretrained models with human-in-the-loop validation to ensure diversity and balance. ADOPD provides densely annotated document images for four key tasks: **Doc2Mask, Doc2Box, Doc2Tag, and Doc2Seq**. Each image includes entity masks, text bounding boxes, and descriptive tags and captions. Among these tasks, **Doc2Mask** and **Doc2Box** are annotated by humans with model assistance, while **Doc2Tag** and **Doc2Seq** are initially generated by large language models (LLMs) and subsequently refined by human annotators.
